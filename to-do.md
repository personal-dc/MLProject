TODO
- plot multi-dimensional data in 2d (on piazza)
- ~~use cross validation or hyper-parameter tuning on our models (using GridSearchCV)~~
- use different classifiers in sklearn
- read more about DNNs that are used specifically for such use cases (https://towardsdatascience.com/designing-your-neural-networks-a5e4617027ed)
- use XGB and refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/xgboost-HowItWorks.html
- use top x most important parameters (x = 3 or 4) [https://www.kaggle.com/code/pablocastilla/predict-if-a-shot-is-made#Find-XGB-better-configuration]
