to-do
- plot multi-dimensional data in 2d (on piazza)
- use cross validation or hyper-parameter tuning on our models (using GridSearchCV)
- use different classifiers in sklearn
- read more about DNNs that are used specifically for such use cases 
- use top x most important parameters (x = 3 or 4) [https://www.kaggle.com/code/pablocastilla/predict-if-a-shot-is-made#Find-XGB-better-configuration]
